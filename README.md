# Venture Funding with Deep Learning
# Overview
The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model to predict the likelihood of venture funding for a startup based on various features such as the industry, the number of employees, the funding round, etc. The dataset used in this project includes information on startups and their funding history. The target variable to predict is whether a startup will receive funding or not.
Multiple deep learning models will be built and tested, including:
1. Original Model
2. Alternative Model 1
3. Alternative Model 2
4. Alternative Model 3
Each alternative model will implement different optimization techniques, such as increasing the number of neurons, adding more hidden layers, using different activation functions, adjusting the input data, or changing the number of epochs.
